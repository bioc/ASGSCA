Description: The package provides tools to model and test the
        association between multiple genotypes and multiple traits,
        taking into account the prior biological knowledge. Genes, and
        clinical pathways are incorporated in the model as latent
        variables. The method is based on Generalized Structured
        Component Analysis (GSCA).
